# An Industry Guide to Becoming a Software Engineer by Bill Langenberg. 

This is a guide were Bill Langenberg talks about very key points needed to succeed 
in the Sofware Engineering filed. The first category he touches on in his paper is 
Core Computer Science Skills. Data Structure which falls under this category of Core 
Computer Science Skills you should know as a Software Engineer lists some specific 
examples of what you should be failiar with some examples are given, Hash Structure, 
List and Arrays, Trees and graphs, Iterators and Generics. The main idea you should 
know is how common data structures work under the covers he points out.
From there he moves on to Algorithm Analysis which we find within the same category 
as Data Structure. Being familiar with the lists of examples given above will come 
in handy when doing algorithm analysis, because this deals with writing code and proving 
code review.
Other core coputer science skills that you should have in your arsenal are problem solving &
debugging, and coding fluency
Mr. Langenberg saids that in his opinion in-depth knowledge of data structure and the 
ability to perform algorithm and impact analysis is what separates engineers from developers.  
  There are some skills that you must acquire on your own these are; Linux, choosing the right tools
for the job, basic security, and how to be productive.
Understanding and being able to manage a linux server is something that you should 
be able to get on your own Mr. Langenberg points out. 
Choosing the right tool for the job means being able to use one line of code instead of 
using a ten lines to get the same job done this is based on the paper we have read.
There a set of indidpensible tools provided by the paper these are, C/C++, Java, C# or another 
core, object-oriented language. Python, Bash shell scripting and SQL.
Being familiar with security vulnerabilities is what is meant by basic security. You should know about
Buffer overflow, SQL injection, XSS and CSRF.
Being productive is a very important point in the paper. A great advice that is given is to spend
30-60 minutes trying to figure something out yourself before interrupting someone else, unless the
question can be answer out of hand.
The last part of the paper talks about what employers look for in a potencial employee.
Employers want to see: Quality iinternships in the field, an active coding project that you're excited
about, a reasonable GPA, Completed courses that fill out the Core CS Skills and Hackathon participation.
Mr. Langenberg finishes his paper with his final remarks stating that you should be strategic about your
career even when you dont know what you want to do.
One of the things he saids that I feel is important is to Periodically reflect and adjust.
